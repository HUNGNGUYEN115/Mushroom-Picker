  mushroominfor: "\u2022\tThe Fly Agaric is probably the most iconic mushroom in
    the forest, with its bright red cap and white speckles straight out of a fairy
    tale. While it\u2019s stunning to look at, don\u2019t eat it! This mushroom is
    toxic in its raw form and should be avoided unless you're a mushroom expert\u2014although
    it\u2019s been used in ancient rituals (safely, mind you). You\u2019ll find it
    in birch, pine, and spruce forests across Finland, especially in autumn. So,
    while it makes for a great photo op, leave it be!"
