  mushroomname: 'Liberty Cap '
  mushroominfor: "The Liberty Cap is like the mischievous cousin of the mushroom
    world. Tiny, bell-shaped, and a little too adventurous for most, this mushroom
    packs a psychedelic punch. Containing psilocybin, it\u2019s not the kind of mushroom
    you want to casually snack on, unless you're a fan of strange trips and questionable
    decisions. So, do yourself a favor: don\u2019t pick this! Keep your eyes on the
    ground and leave this little hallucinogenic wonder to the more experienced foragers.
    Found in meadows and grasslands, especially after autumn rains, it\u2019s best
    admired from a distance. Trust me, your brain will thank you!"
