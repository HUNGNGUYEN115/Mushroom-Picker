  mushroominfor: "The Woolly Milk-cap is a little quirky, with its reddish-brown
    cap with wool-like texture and the surprising milk it oozes when cut. This mushroom
    isn\u2019t for the faint of heart\u2014it has a bitter streak! But once you soak
    it to remove that bitterness, it transforms into a tasty treat, perfect for frying
    or pickling. It\u2019s commonly found in Finland\u2019s coniferous and mixed
    forests from late summer through autumn. Just be patient with it\u2014good things
    come to those who wait (and soak)!"
